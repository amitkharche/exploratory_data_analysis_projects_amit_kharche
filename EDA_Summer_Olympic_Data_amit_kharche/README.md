## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** Publicly available Summer Olympics dataset  
- **Instances:** 31,165  
- **Target Analysis Area:** Participation and Medal Distribution  
- **Features Include:**
  - **Athlete Info:** Name, Gender, Country
  - **Sport Metadata:** Sport, Discipline, Event
  - **Event Info:** Year, City, Season
  - **Performance:** Medal type (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
> **Note:** Minor missing values in `Country` field. Categorical columns standardized and cleaned during preprocessing.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess historical Olympic data  
- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis  
- Visualize trends in medal wins by sport, country, and gender  
- Examine changes in event count and disciplines over time  
- Generate actionable insights from medal patterns and host performance

## 📈 Key Analyses Performed

- Bar plots for top medal-winning athletes, sports, and cities  
- Pie chart to analyze medal type distribution  
- Line charts to explore trends in event and participation counts  
- Count plots for gender distribution and medal categories  
- Area plot of decade-wise discipline expansion and medal awards  
- Heatmaps and cross-tabulations for sport-gender-country relationships

---

## 📌 Insights

- **USA** leads in overall medals and golds, followed by **USSR** and **GBR**.  
- **Aquatics** and **Athletics** are the top-performing sports in both events and golds.  
- **London**, **Athens**, and **Los Angeles** are the most frequent Olympic host cities.  
- Participation and disciplines have **steadily increased post-1980**, showing global expansion.  
- **Gender disparities** exist in both participation and medal counts, with men dominating overall.

## 💡 Actionable Recommendations

- 🌍 Enhance training and infrastructure support in **emerging countries** for competitive balance.  
- 🚺 Promote **gender inclusivity** by increasing female representation in underrepresented sports.  
- 🏙️ Leverage cities like **London** and **Athens** as strategic planning models for future Olympics.  
- 🥇 Prioritize investments in **high-yield sports** like Aquatics, Athletics, and Gymnastics.  
- 📊 Use **historical participation trends** to optimize logistics and resource allocation for future Games.
