    "\n",
    "Employee retention is a critical concern for any organization, especially in the fast-paced and competitive environment of the software industry. High attrition rates not only disrupt team dynamics but also increase recruitment and training costs. Traditionally, the HR department at this software company has relied on **exit interviews** to understand why employees choose to leave. While these interviews offer valuable insights, they are inherently **reactive**—conducted only after the decision to exit has been made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing these limitations, the HR team is initiating a **proactive, data-driven approach** to enhance employee retention. The goal is to analyze historical data to uncover trends and signals indicative of potential attrition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This EDA focuses on **permanent employees**—the company's long-term talent. The dataset includes demographics, job roles, performance, and employment status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- Assess data structure and quality.\n",
    "- Identify attrition-related patterns.\n",
    "- Generate insights to inform HR strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This foundation may later support predictive modeling.\n"

    "# **2. Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The HR department of a software company currently depends on **exit interviews** to determine why employees leave. However, this **reactive method** has several drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insights vary in quality based on who conducts the interview.\n",
    "- Data from interviews is hard to consolidate and analyze at scale.\n",
    "- Crucially, feedback arrives too late—after the employee has left.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these limitations, HR seeks a **proactive, data-driven strategy** by examining historical employee data. The focus is on uncovering **patterns and drivers** of attrition among **permanent employees**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project centers on conducting **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using a dataset that includes attributes of both current and former employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- Discover features correlated with attrition.\n",
    "- Analyze demographic and organizational factors influencing retention.\n",
    "- Derive actionable insights to guide HR interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this EDA aims to support a forward-looking HR strategy and enable early engagement with at-risk employees.\n"
