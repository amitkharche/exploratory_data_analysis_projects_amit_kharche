# üìä Analysis on Facebook Utilization

This project performs an end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Facebook user dataset to uncover insights related to user demographics, engagement behavior, friendship patterns, and platform usage. The analysis leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, and includes both visual storytelling and actionable business recommendations.

## üìå Objectives

- Understand user demographics (age, gender, tenure)
- Analyze engagement metrics (likes, friendships)
- Compare usage behavior across mobile and web platforms
- Identify behavioral patterns by age group and gender
- Generate actionable insights to inform social media strategy

## üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset contains anonymized Facebook user metrics with the following key features:

| Column                   | Description                                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `userid`                | Unique identifier for each user              |
| `age`                   | Age of the user                              |
| `gender`                | Gender of the user                           |
| `tenure`                | Days since the user joined Facebook          |
| `friend_count`          | Number of friends                            |
| `friendships_initiated`| Number of friendships initiated               |
| `likes`, `likes_received` | Total likes and likes received            |
| `mobile_likes`, `www_likes` | Likes via mobile app or website         |
| `mobile_likes_received`, `www_likes_received` | Likes received by platform |
| `dob_day`, `dob_month`, `dob_year` | Date of birth information        |

## üîç Key Analyses & Visualizations

- **Age Distribution & Age Grouping**
- **Gender-wise Analysis (Counts, Engagement)**
- **Friendship Patterns (Count & Initiation)**
- **Likes Behavior (Sent & Received across platforms)**
- **Correlation Matrix and Pairwise Plots**
- **Outlier Detection in Friend Counts**
- **Tenure Analysis by Age and Gender**
- **FacetGrid and Barplots for Comparative Trends**

## ‚úÖ Conclusion Highlights

- Majority of users are **15‚Äì30 years old**.
- **Female users are more engaged**, despite being fewer in number.
- **Mobile and Website usage is high** for both liking and receiving likes.
- **Friendships initiated differ by age and gender** (e.g., young females initiate more).
- **Engagement behavior varies significantly by demographic segment**.
