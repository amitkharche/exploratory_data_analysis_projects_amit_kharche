# üìò Facebook Utilization ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project dives into a user-level dataset from Facebook to uncover how **age**, **gender**, **tenure**, and **engagement metrics** such as **friendships** and **likes** shape user behavior. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis, the project reveals key patterns, anomalies, and behavioral insights that can help platforms or businesses understand their audience better.

---

## üìä Dataset Overview

- **Source:** Simulated Facebook user data (publicly available)
- **Instances:** 99,000+
- **Target Attribute:** No specific target ‚Äì Unsupervised analysis
- **Features Include:**
  - **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Date of Birth
  - **Behavioral Metrics:** Tenure, Friend Count, Friendships Initiated
  - **Engagement:** Likes (Mobile, Web), Likes Received (Mobile, Web)
  - **Derived Fields:** Age Group, Date of Birth Grouping

> **Note:** Missing values were handled via imputation; outliers were retained for behavior profiling.

---

## üìå Project Objectives

- Clean, preprocess, and enrich raw Facebook user data
- Create derived variables such as age groups and age bands
- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate EDA
- Analyze patterns in friendships, likes, and user activity
- Identify correlations between user attributes and engagement levels
- Generate business-ready insights for platform optimization

---

## üîß Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Plotly for interactive visuals
- ydata-profiling for automated data reports
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## üìà Key Analyses Performed

- **Distribution plots** for age, tenure, likes, and friendships
- **Count plots** for age groups, gender splits, and DOB analysis
- **Box plots** for tenure and engagement by age group
- **Correlation heatmap** and **pair plot** for feature relationships
- **Scatter plots** comparing friendships vs. likes, gender patterns
- **Pie charts** to visualize platform (Mobile vs Web) usage
- **Outlier detection** for high-friend-count or like-heavy users

---

## üìå Insights

- The **21‚Äì30 age group** dominates Facebook usage.
- **Female users** show **higher engagement** in likes and initiating friendships despite being fewer.
- A **strong positive correlation** exists between **friend count** and **friendships initiated**.
- Most users have **low to moderate likes**, while a few show **extremely high engagement**.
- **Tenure increases with age**, suggesting **older users stay longer** on the platform.
- Likes are more frequent on **mobile apps** than websites.
- Activity drops off after **1000 days of tenure**, indicating a **decline in long-term user engagement**.
- Age groups **above 80 and below 30** show **higher friend counts**, suggesting generational extremes are more connected.

---

## üí° Actionable Recommendations

- üì≤ Prioritize **mobile-first UX enhancements** due to high mobile engagement.
- üéØ Tailor features toward the **15‚Äì30 age group** to strengthen user retention.
- üë• Promote friend suggestion algorithms for users with **low friend counts or initiation**.
- üß† Introduce **re-engagement campaigns** targeting users with **tenure > 1000 days**.
- üßì Build specialized content experiences for **older users**, who show longer retention.
- üìä Use **female-oriented campaign strategies**, as they demonstrate stronger engagement.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Apply data validation rules to flag **anomalies** (e.g., users aged 113).
- üìå Monitor high-activity outliers for potential **influencer identification or misuse detection**.
