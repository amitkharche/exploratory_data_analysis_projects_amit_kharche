# ‚úàÔ∏è Airline Passenger Satisfaction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset containing survey responses from airline passengers to uncover insights into **factors influencing passenger satisfaction**. Through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and correlations across various service and demographic features that impact satisfaction levels.

## üìÇ Dataset Description

The dataset includes information from over **83,000 passengers**, with features covering:

- **Demographics**: Gender, Age, Customer Type
- **Travel Info**: Type of Travel, Class, Flight Distance
- **Service Ratings**: Inflight Wi-Fi, Food, Seat Comfort, Entertainment, Online Boarding, etc.
- **Flight Experience**: Departure/Arrival Delays
- **Target Variable**: `Satisfaction` (Satisfied or Neutral/Dissatisfied)
