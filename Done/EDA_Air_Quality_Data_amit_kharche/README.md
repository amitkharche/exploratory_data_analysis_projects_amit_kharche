# 🌫️ Air Quality Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Urban Pollution Monitoring

This project explores a year-long dataset of air quality sensor readings collected in a heavily polluted urban environment in Italy. Using various data visualization and statistical techniques, the analysis uncovers patterns, relationships, and actionable insights related to atmospheric pollutants, environmental conditions, and sensor behavior.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Time Period:** March 2004 – February 2005  
- **Frequency:** Hourly recordings  
- **Location:** Road-level monitoring in an Italian city  
- **Instances:** 9,358  
- **Target Variables:**
  - `CO(GT)` – Carbon Monoxide (mg/m³)
  - `NMHC(GT)` – Non-Methane Hydrocarbons (µg/m³)
  - `C6H6(GT)` – Benzene (µg/m³)
  - `NOx(GT)` – Nitrogen Oxides (ppb)
  - `NO2(GT)` – Nitrogen Dioxide (µg/m³)

- **Sensor Readings:** 5 metal oxide sensors
- **Environmental Variables:** Temperature (°C), Relative Humidity (%), Absolute Humidity

> **Note:** Missing values are marked as `-200` and handled during preprocessing.

## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw data  
- Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis  
- Understand pollutant patterns over time and by external factors  
- Detect anomalies, sensor drift, and environmental influences  
- Generate actionable business and policy insights

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
- ydata-profiling / pandas-profiling (for initial data profiling)

---

## 📈 Key Analyses Performed

- Time series plots for pollutant trends  
- Violin plots for distribution visualization  
- Box plots comparing CO levels: Day vs Night  
- Correlation matrix of all numeric variables  
- Donut chart of average pollutant concentration  
- Sensor vs environmental variable relationships  
- Weekday-based RH analysis  
- Detection and removal of invalid values (`-200`)

---

## 📌 Insights

- **NOx(GT)** and **NO2(GT)** dominate urban air pollution profiles.
- **CO** and **Benzene** show peak concentrations during rush hours.
- **Sensor readings** are influenced by **temperature and humidity**, requiring calibration.
- **Strong correlations** between ground truth and sensor readings validate their reliability.
- **Missing/invalid entries (-200)** must be handled to ensure accurate modeling.

---

## 💡 Actionable Recommendations

- Implement stricter traffic emission controls during peak hours.
- Calibrate sensors for environmental factors like humidity and temperature.
- Enhance data collection infrastructure to minimize missing data.
- Focus on NOx and NO2 reduction policies and pollution forecasting based on climate patterns.
